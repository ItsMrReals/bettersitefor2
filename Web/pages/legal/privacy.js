            <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</em></p>
            <p>Our Website offers you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public on such social media platform.</p>
            <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Website. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

            <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong>  <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong>  <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
            <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.</p>

In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the <a href="#contact">contact details</a> provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
            <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
            <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

            <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies.

            <p><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. </p>
            <p><strong>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong>  <em>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></p>
